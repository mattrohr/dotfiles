## About

Dotfiles are shell script files that backup, restore, and sync system settings. Named with a leading period (e.g. [`.zshrc`](./.zshrc)), they remain hidden on Unix-like operating systems.

## Installation

1. (_macOS only_) Sign into Mac App Store to install macOS apps listed in [`Brewfile`](./Brewfile) may be installed.

2. Clone repository and configure the machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattrohr/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./install.sh
```

3. Refer to [`manual.md`](./manual.md) for manual installation steps.

## Notes

"If `.secret` exists, it will be sourced in [`.zshrc`](./.zshrc) with other files. Use it for commands, files, and directories you donâ€™t want in a public repository, like server credentials, blacklisted websites, and cryptographic keys."

Scripts are idempotent: they can be rerun safely. Useful for when settings reset, like after macOS updates reset Touch ID sudo authentication."

If you're new to macOS, read [tips and tricks](./tips.md).

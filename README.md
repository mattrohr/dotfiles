## About

These files backup, restore, and sync my system settings with ubiquitous shell scripting. They're called "dotfiles" because they typically are named with a leading period (e.g. [`.zshrc`](./.zshrc)), which makes them hidden by default on Unix-like operating systems.

## Installation

1. (_macOS only_) Log into Mac App Store so macOS apps specified in [`Brewfile`](./Brewfile) may be installed.

2. Clone repository and configure machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattrohr/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./install.sh
```

3. See [`manual.md`](./manual.md) for manual installation steps.

## Notes

If `.secret` exists, it will be sourced in [`.zshrc`](./.zshrc) along with the other files. You may use this to add commands, files, and directories you donâ€™t want to commit to a public repository like server credentials (i.e. `~/.ssh/config`), blacklisted websites (i.e. `/etc/hosts`), and cryptographic keys (i.e. `~/.gnupg/`).

Scripts are idempotent: they can safely be run again. This is useful when settings get reset, like when macOS updates clobber Touch ID sudo authentication.

Finally, if you're new to macOS, read [tips and tricks](./tips.md).

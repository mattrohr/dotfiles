_Friends have asked about switching to Mac, so I've documented some basic tips here:_
# Configuration:
Using vanilla un-configured or mildly-configured Mac OS for a month or so gives you a baseline for knowing when your configured Mac is operating oddly.

# Shortcuts:
## Shortcuts I use 100's of times a day:
* ⌘ + Space	<p>action to bring up spotlight search</p>
* ⌘ + T <p>action to bring up a new tab in your app (e.g. Chrome, Terminal)</p>
* ⌘ + ~ <p>switch between windows of an application</p>
* CTRL + Tab <p>move forward through tabs (in same window). Use it a ton for browser research</p>
* CTRL + Shift + Tab <p>move backward through tabs (in same window)</p>
* ⌘ + C and ⌘ + V <p>copy and paste with formatting</p>
* Option + ⌘ + Shift + V <p>paste without formatting</p>
* ⌘ + Q <p>close (fully) app (note: Red X in top left is often a mix of closing the file and minimizing it. The app is technically still running. In Windows, an application that's still running is often still a RAM/CPU resource hog. Macs are more optimized, so it's usually not bad if the app is running in the background. I only use ⌘ + Q to reduce dock clutter, not for performance reasons.)</p>

## Shortcuts I use 1-10 times a day's of times a day:
* Screen shot/screen capture
* ⌘ + Click on the title of a Finder window to navigate directories
* ⌘ + P <p>print (note: you can easily save to pdf from the menu that appears)</p>

## Shortcuts I should use, but old habits die hard:
* ⌘ ↑ and ⌘ ↓ <p>to go up/down the folder hierarchy</p>
*  ⇧ ⌘ A <p>for Applications folder while in Finder. Browse this folder to see what's available (Disk Utility, and Activity Monitor are particularly useful for power-users).</p>

# Generic Tips:
* When your moving files and you need a "safe" space to drop a file in a directory with many other directories, you can drag the item to the Name/Date Modified/Size/Kind column
* When using Terminal.app, you can drag an item (file/directory) into the terminal to enter its full path
* Click and hold green traffic light in a window to have basic control over its position
* There's hidden options you can uncover with option. For example opening an image >> ⌥ + Click File gives you "Save As". If you click it and again press ⌥ + click Format dropdown, you have additonal file type options to save as.
* To change default application for a file. Right click a file of the file type you want to change the default of >> Get Info >> Open With dropdown >> Select application >> Change All...
* If you use Terminal/ZSH often, you may like to know difference between ZSH configuration files: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/71253/what-should-shouldnt-go-in-zshenv-zshrc-zlogin-zprofile-zlogout

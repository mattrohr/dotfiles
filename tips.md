Friends have asked about switching to Mac, so I've documented some tips here:

# Configuration:
You may want to use vanilla, un-configured, or mildly-configured macOS for a month or so. This will give you a baseline to know when your configured Mac is operating oddly.

# Shortcuts:
## Shortcuts I use 100's of times a day:
- **⌘Space** bring up spotlight search
- **⌘T** bring up a new Tab in your app (e.g. browser, Terminal)
- **⌘C and ⌘V** copy and paste with formatting
- **⌥⌘ShiftV** paste without formatting
- **⌥← or or ⌥→** move text (e.g. terminal commands) by word units rather than character units
- **⌘Q** fully close app
- **⌘L** select the contents of the search bar
- **⌘Tab and ⌘ShiftTab** shuffle through applications (note: file can be dragged onto the icons that appear)
- **⌘\` and ⌘\`Tab** shuffle through Windows of the same application
- **⌘Tab and ⌘ShiftTab** shuffle through Tabs in same window
- **⌘click or middle-click** open link in new browser Tab

## Shortcuts I use 1-10 times a day's of times a day:
- **⌘Shift4 or ⌘Shift5** Screen shot (note: press space after either of them to select a specific window)
- **⌘click Finder title** navigate directories
- **⌘P** print (note: you can easily save to pdf from the menu that appears, or even populate envelope after selecting an individual in Contacts.app)
- **⌘Shift.** unhides and hides hidden system files
- **⌘ShiftT** reopen recently closed browser Tab(s). Reopens one if you quit only one, reopens all if you closed the whole browser
- **⌘F** search within a document or webpage
- **Tab** completion in Terminal.app
- **⌘C** fuzzy search directories to `cd` into, in Terminal.app (requires FZF)
- **^T** fuzzy search files in Terminal.app (requires FZF)
- **⌃R** search command history in Terminal.app (improved with FZF)
- **⌃Z** suspend a process in Terminal.app 
- **^L** clear page with scroll-back
- **^K** clear page without scroll-back
- **^U** clear everything before cursor in Terminal.app
- **^K** clear everything after cursor in Terminal.app
- **^W** delete previous word in Terminal.app
- **^U** jump to end of Terminal.app line
- **⌥left click** Option-click to navigate to a point in Terminal.app
- **middle click** to paste selected Terminal.app text
- **double-right click video** Select picture and picture in Safari.app
- **\\[command]** run the non-aliased version (e.g. `\ls`) in Terminal.app
- **⌘↑ and ⌘↓** navigate up/down folder hierarchy
- **⌘Shift A** open Applications folder while in Finder. Browse this folder to see what's available (Disk Utility, and Activity Monitor are particularly useful for power-users)
- **Partial wordF5** see completion options

## Generic Tips:
- You can search an application's menus under `Help`
- When your moving files and you need a "safe" space to drop a file in a directory with many other directories, you can drag the item to the Name/Date Modified/Size/Kind column
- Sometimes form fields, especially password, don't let you paste into them. You can select the text, then click and drag it into the field to prevent having to retype it
- When using Terminal.app, you can drag an item (file/directory) into the terminal to enter its full path
- Click and hold green traffic light in a window to have basic control over its position
- There's hidden options you can uncover with option. For example opening an image >> ⌥Click File gives you "Save As". If you click it and again press ⌥click Format dropdown, you have additional file type options to save as.
- When selecting a large body of work, like text or photos, you don't need to click and drag. For text, for instance, you can click on one part, click where you want to start the copy, go press want to end the selection, press Shift and click the ending
- Select program in terminal, then tap the man button that appears on the left of the Touch Bar. The resulting detached man page may then be searched
- [Be careful copying commands from websites and pasting them in terminal](https://briantracy.xyz/writing/copy-paste-shell.html)
